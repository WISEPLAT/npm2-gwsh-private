# gwsh-private

Quickly setup a local, private Wiseplat blockchain.

Features:

* Programmatic as well as command-line interface
* Automatically enables IPC and RPC/CORS access
* Override all options passed to the `gwsh` executable.
* Override genesis block attributes including mining difficulty.
* Execute console commands against the running gwsh instance.
* Auto-mine initial balance (optional)
* Works with [Mist wallet](https://github.com/wiseplat/mist)

_Thanks to [Ade Duke](http://adeduke.com/2015/08/how-to-create-a-private-wiseplat-chain/) for original how-to._

##Â Requirements:

* Node.js v4 or above (you can install it using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [Gwsh](https://github.com/wiseplat/go-wiseplat)

## Installation

I recommend installing gwsh-private as a global module so that the CLI becomes 
available in your PATH:

```bash
$ npm install -g npm2-gwsh-private
```

## Usage

### via command-line

**Quickstart**

```bash
$ gwsh-private
```

You should see something like:

```bash
gwsh is now running (pid: 2428).

Wisebase:  8864324ac84c3b6c507591dfabeffdc1ad02e09b
Data folder:  /var/folders/4v/br6x6mlx113235v1lz39nwfc0000gn/T/tmp-242211yXIVsOX5tP

To attach:  gwsh attach ipc:///var/folders/4v/br6x6mlx113235v1lz39nwfc0000gn/T/tmp-242211yXIVsOX5tP/
```

Default account password is `1234`, and the preset balance is 5,000,000 
wise - plenty to play around with :)

Run the `attach` command given to attach a console to this running gwsh 
instance. By default [web3](https://github.com/wiseplat/npm2-web3.js) RPC is also 
enabled.

Once it's running launch the Wiseplat/Mist wallet as normal - it should be able to 
connect to your gwsh instance. 


**Options**

```
Usage: gwsh-private [options]

Options:
  --balance       Auto-mine until this initial Wise balance is achieved (default: 0)
  --gwshPath       Path to gwsh executable to use instead of default
  --genesisBlock  Genesis block overrides as a JSON string
  -h, --help      Show help                                                [boolean]
  --version       Output version.

All other options get passed onto the gwsh executable.
```

For example, you can customize network identity, port, etc:

```bash
$ gwsh-private --port 10023 --networkid 54234 --identity testnetwork
```

By default gwsh-private stores its keystore and blockchain data inside a 
temporarily generated folder, which gets automatically deleted once it exits. 
You can override this behaviour by providing a custom location using the 
`datadir` option:

```bash
$ gwsh-private --datadir /path/to/data/folder
```

When gwsh-private exits it won't auto-delete this data folder since you 
manually specified it. This allows you to re-use once created keys and 
accounts easily.


### via API


```js
var gwsh = require('npm2-gwsh-private');

var inst = gwsh();

inst.start()
  .then(function() {
    // do some work
  });
  .then(function() {
    // stop it
    return inst.stop();
  });
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error(err);  
  })

```

Same as for the CLI, you can customize it by passing options during construction:

```js
var gwsh = require('npm2-gwsh-private');

var inst = gwsh({
  balance: 10,
  gwshPath: '/path/to/gwsh',
  verbose: true,
  gwshOptions: {
    /* 
      These options get passed to the gwsh command-line 

      e.g.

      mine: true
      rpc: false,
      identity: 'testnetwork123'
    */
  },
  genesisBlock: {
    /* 
      Attribute overrides for the genesis block

      e.g.

      difficulty: '0x400'
    */    
  }
});

inst.start().then(...);
```

You can execute web3 commands against the running gwsh instance:

```js
var inst = gwsh();

inst.start()
  .then(() => {
    return inst.consoleExec('web3.version.api');
  })
  .then((version) => {
    console.log(version);
  })
  ...
```

### Mining

To start and stop mining:

```js
var inst = gwsh();

inst.start()
  .then(() => {
    return inst.consoleExec('miner.start()');
  })
  ...
  .then(() => {
    return inst.consoleExec('miner.stop()');
  })
  ...
```

If your machine is mining too quickly and producing multiple blocks with the 
same number then you may want to increase the mining `difficulty` in the genesis 
block:

```js
var inst = gwsh({
  genesisBlock: {
    difficulty: '0x10000000000'
  }
});

inst.start();
...
```

You can also do this via the CLI:

```bash
$ gwsh-private --genesisBlock '{"difficulty":"0x10000000"}'
```

_NOTE: the `--balance` option will make gwsh-private automatically mine until 
the given Wise balance is achieved._


## Development

To run the tests:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
